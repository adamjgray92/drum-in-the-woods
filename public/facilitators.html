        <h2>MICHAEL KAMUNDA</h2>
        <img src="img/michael.jpg" alt="Michael Kamunda" class="left">
        <p>Michael is the Artistic Director/Choreographer of the group Pamuzinda,
Michael started his career at a very tender age of 5yrs as he is born in a family
with a background of a typical Zimbabwean tradition. Traditional ceremonies
where mbira instruments and traditional dances are performed occasionally
took place at his homestead.</p>
        <blockquote>
          &ldquo;
            I was watching them when ever they were performing at these ceremonies
            then I just tell myself that I can also do this and from there I started
            trying it on my own. &rdquo;
            <cite>Michael Kamunda</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He then taught himself the art of playing instruments, singing and
          dancing that resulted in him being a multi-instrumentalist. He used
          to collect empty bottles and tins and create sounds by hitting them.</p>
        <blockquote>
          &ldquo;
            I could spent the whole day hitting the bottles and the tins that
            sometimes i forget of eating and I had my audience from my friends
            and people around who always come to watch me play, dance and sing.
            &rdquo;
            <cite>Michael Kamunda</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          He got the experience as he grew up and perfected his talents in music,
          dance and theatre arts by practising everyday as well as performing
          with Pamuzinda and other renowned artists locally and internationally.
          Michael have being travelling around the globe as a performer and
          instructor as from 1994 until to date on his mission to pass the message
          in preserving and sharing his culture to the world. He has held successful
          workshops in Voice training, dance and instrument playing mainly his own
          traditional instruments of Zimbabwe the mbira, marimba and ngoma (traditional drums)
          in countries like Belgium, Italy, United States of America,
          United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Japan, Luxenbourg; Netherlands,
          South Africa, Zambia also not leaving his home country Zimbabwe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from working with Pamuzinda Michael has been also working with
          other artists from his home land providing his services as a
          session/hired artist that also contributed for him to gain the much
          experience he possess today but that never make him forgot about
          his group because that's where he belong and Pamuzinda is his home.
